# AI-Assisted Medical Diagnosis System

## Project Overview
The **AI-Assisted Medical Diagnosis System** is a robust AI solution designed to assist healthcare professionals by analyzing medical images (e.g., X-rays, CT scans) and clinical notes to provide diagnostic support. This project leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to process both textual data and medical images, combining these modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

The system aims to reduce the burden on healthcare professionals by automating the initial diagnosis process, flagging potential abnormalities, and generating reports based on both image and text data.

## Features
- **Multimodal AI Integration**: Combines text (clinical notes, patient history) and image (medical scans) data for improved diagnostics.
- **Medical Image Analysis**: Detects abnormalities like lung diseases from X-rays using fine-tuned image models.
- **Clinical Note Processing**: Extracts key insights from patient records using NLP models fine-tuned on biomedical data.
- **Real-time Inference**: Provides immediate feedback, assisting doctors in diagnosing conditions based on medical data.
- **Web-Based Interface**: Simple front-end interface allowing healthcare professionals to upload images and patient notes.

## Tech Stack

### **Core Technologies**
- **Python**: Core language used for development.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: To leverage pretrained models for NLP and computer vision tasks.
- **PyTorch**: For model training and fine-tuning on custom medical datasets.
- **Datasets**: Hugging Faceâ€™s library for efficient data preprocessing and loading.
- **Streamlit** (or **Flask**) for the front-end user interface.

### **Pretrained Models**
- **BioBERT** or **ClinicalBERT**: For processing and understanding clinical text.
- **EfficientNet**, **ResNet**, or **Vision Transformers (ViT)**: For medical image classification.
- **MedCLIP**: Multimodal model for integrating image and text data.

### **Additional Tools**
- **OpenCV**: For medical image preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and handling structured datasets.
- **Accelerate**: To optimize model training on Apple Silicon.


### 6. **Use Cases**
- Upload a medical image (e.g., chest X-ray).
- Add relevant clinical notes or patient history.
- Receive a diagnosis with visual highlights on the medical image and a text-based summary.


## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Image Segmentation**: Adding segmentation capabilities to highlight abnormal regions in medical images.
- **Model Deployment on Cloud**: Deploy the system using Hugging Face Spaces or cloud platforms like AWS for large-scale use.
- **Continuous Learning**: Allow the system to improve as more data is processed over time.
